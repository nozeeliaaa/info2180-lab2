        <h2>Oh Look, I Can Code Now! ღ</h2>

        <p> So, web development, who honestly would've thought I'd actually enjoy it? Honestly, INFO2180 has been the most interesting course for me this semester. It’s the one class that makes me feel like a proper “coder,” if you get what I mean. I’ve been watching loads of videos and even trying a few things on my own. The whole web development experience has been surprisingly straightforward, which is what I appreciate most. I can tap into my creative side, and it actually feels like I’m having fun while learning new things. Plus, the more I dive into it, the more I realise just how versatile these skills can be for future projects.</p>
        <p>While web development has been fun and all, cybersecurity is what really fascinates me. There's just something about understanding how systems are protected that keeps pulling me in. Honestly, both web development and cybersecurity connect more than you'd think. Learning how to build websites helps me spot potential vulnerabilities, making me more aware of security risks from the get-go. It's like, I’m learning how to create stuff but also figuring out how to protect it at the same time. The more I explore both, the more I see how they work together, and I’m really excited to dive deeper into that balance.</p>

        <h2>Spa Vibes Only ღ</h2>

        <p>Honestly, I’m in desperate need of a spa day! I’m flashing back to the last time I treated myself, and let me tell you, it was everything. Just walking in, the scent of lavender and eucalyptus hit me instantly, and that cozy robe? Total heaven. I started with a Swedish massage which was 45 minutes of pure bliss as every knot and bit of tension just melted away. The therapist knew all the spots that needed work, and by the end, I was practically floating up in heaven. Then came the mani-pedi. Choosing the polish color was a whole event in itself, but watching my nails transform was so satisfying. And that facial! I could feel my skin come back to life with every step; cleanse, scrub, mask, it was like a mini makeover. And to top it all off? I just kicked back in their lounge, sipping wine and snacking on the cutest cheese and cracker spread.I’m convinced that a day like this is the cure to everything life throws at me. This degree has been nonstop stress, and the thought of another spa escape? Let’s just say, it’s calling my name.</p>
        <p>If this degree doesn’t pan out, which it totally will, I’ve got my sights set on opening my own salon. Just picture it: a space filled with lash techs, hairdressers, nail techs, masseuses, and waxologists, all under one roof. I would dive headfirst into that world of beauty and self-care. Even with my computer science degree, I’d make bank because, let’s be real, my main goal is to keep my shopping habit alive and well! It’s a toss-up between pursuing a career in computer science or becoming an esthetician, but either way, I’m determined to find a way to blend my passions and make money doing what I love.</p>
