        <h2>The Fun Side of INFO2180 ღ</h2>

        <p> So, web development, who honestly would've thought I'd actually enjoy it? Honestly, INFO2180 has been the most interesting course for me this semester. It’s the one class that makes me feel like a proper “coder,” if you get what I mean. I’ve been watching loads of videos and even trying a few things on my own. The whole web development experience has been surprisingly straightforward, which is what I appreciate most. I can tap into my creative side, and it actually feels like I’m having fun while learning new things. Plus, the more I dive into it, the more I realise just how versatile these skills can be for future projects.</p>
        <p>While web development has been fun and all, cybersecurity is what really fascinates me. There's just something about understanding how systems are protected that keeps pulling me in. Honestly, both web development and cybersecurity connect more than you'd think. Learning how to build websites helps me spot potential vulnerabilities, making me more aware of security risks from the get-go. It's like, I’m learning how to create stuff but also figuring out how to protect it at the same time. The more I explore both, the more I see how they work together, and I’m really excited to dive deeper into that balance.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I’m in desperate need of a spa day! Like, just imagine this: a blissful Swedish or deep tissue massage melting away all my stress, followed by a mani-pedi to make my nails look on point. And don’t even get me started on how refreshing a facial would feel right now! Plus, I really need to get my eyebrows on fleek. I just want to kick back, sip some wine, and munch on cheese and crackers while soaking up all that relaxation. This degree is stressing me out, and a day at the spa sounds like the perfect escape to recharge and just breathe!</p>
        <p>If this degree doesn’t pan out, which it totally will, I’ve got my sights set on opening my own salon. Just picture it: a space filled with lash techs, hairdressers, nail techs, masseuses, and waxologists, all under one roof. I would dive headfirst into that world of beauty and self-care. Even with my computer science degree, I’d make bank because, let’s be real, my main goal is to keep my shopping habit alive and well! It’s a toss-up between pursuing a career in computer science or becoming an esthetician, but either way, I’m determined to find a way to blend my passions and make money doing what I love.</p>
